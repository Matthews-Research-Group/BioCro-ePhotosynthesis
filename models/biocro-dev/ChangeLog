2012-10-4 Deepak Jaiswal

	Changes made in BioCro.c
	Changes from Version EnCro 0.031 to EnCro 0.032
	
 Currently, I am now making a seconda call to Canopy with zero light to store output in CanopyRd. This should give us Rd (leaf dark respiration) theoretically, which is used to subtract from net canopy assimilation to get gross photosynthesis______________________________________________________________

2012-9-20 Deeak Jaiswal
Minot change in sunML as developed by Fernando undergrad to be consistent
________________________________________________________________________
2012-5-25 Deepak Jaiswal
Now, I have implemented water stress correctly to LAI. Earlier it was being implemented on Leaf Biomass

2012-5-5 Deepak Jaiswal
I have included updated code of soilML sent by Fernando which corrects for saturated soil water content
I also included an option in soilParms function, this option allows to calculate root depth based on root front velocity or usinf crude approach of biomass*factor
optiondefault value is 1 but it should be given a value of zero to use rootfront velocity
.all the necessary/associated function/function definiion have been chnaged

nitroParms is now taking inputs of max LN, min LN (mmol/m2) and day of maxLN to do seasonal variation of top leaf N concentration

____________________________________________________
2012-4-24 Deepak Jaiswal

TOPLNseasonal function is changed to seasonal so that it can be used by both moisture content and also by leaf N module.
Bug in TOPLNseasonal.c is fixed. Earlier, it was calculating wrong date for maximum leaf N concentration, only based on latitute but not considering the parameter maxLNday of the function call. I have removed if conditions in the functionTOPLNseasonal.c

2011-12-15 Deepak Jaiswal <djaiswal@illinois.edu>
I have implemented C function MRespiration in BioCro. It uses actual biomass to calculate maintenance respiration of stem, leaf and root/rhizome separatrely and thereafter correct biomass in main subrotuine BioCro.c. Currently I have hard coded value for parameters of respiration (see gooogle blog and Liu's paper) of sugarcane. I need to write a control functions that can take these parameters as inputs.

2011-12-14 Deepak Jaiswal <djaiswal@illinois.edu>

	Trying to improve c4photoC, c4photo and ballBerry functions.
	Reducing some of the calls to REAL.

2009-10-23  fernando miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

	* BioCro_0.255-1 /src/BioCro.c /src/c4photo.c

	Reducing the number of calls to REAL and INTEGER after a post by Doug Bates in R-devel

	"And I forgot to mention, it is not a good idea to write REAL(Data)
	many times like this.  REAL is a function, not a macro and you are
	calling the same function over and over again unnecessarily.  It is
	better to write

	double *dat = REAL(Data);

	and use the dat pointer instead of REAL(Data)."

	I should apply this throughout the rest of the program, but is
	does not seem that critical since it does not spent too much time
	on this function.
	
2009-10-15  fernando miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

2009-05-26  fernando miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

	* BioCro_0.250-8 /src/BioCro.c /R/BioCro.R

	It seems that there is a limit of 65 arguments that can be passed
	to the .Call interface. Because of this I had to change the
	MCMCBioGro function. After reading the "Writing Extensions" manual
	I see that .Call in fact has a limit of 65 arguments and that
	.External is not limited, but it handles arguments differently.

2009-05-22  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.250-7 /src/BioCro.c /R/BioCro.R

2009-03-06  fernando miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

	* BioCro_0.246-8 /R/OpBioGro.R

	I think I might have finally fixed this function. Applied an
	additive log ratio transformation.

2009-03-05  fernando miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

	* BioCro_0.246-7 /src/BioCro.c

	Fixed bug in line 665. Changed 23 by 24. 

2009-03-03  fernando miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

	* BioCro0.246-6 /src/AuxBioCro.c /src/BioCro.c

	Made some changes suggested by gcc. Warnings, nothing crucial.

2009-02-25  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@ubuntu>

	* BioCro_0.246-5 /src/c4photo.c LN 122, 269 and 274  

	After realizing that the stomatal stress factor would not have an
	effect on assimilation if the argument ws="gs" and StomWS < ~4-5 I
	wanted to see why this happened. It seems that the reason was that
	the inter cellular CO2 had a lower bound of 2 and this prevented
	Assim of going down to zero. 

2009-02-23  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.246-4 /R/weach.R

	Optimized this function to the point where it goes from 1.4 sec to
	0.07 sec. It turns out lightME vectorizes nicely and I wasn't
	using this feature.

	Also fixed a bug in OpBioGro.R where I replaced some lines with drop=FLASE
	
2009-02-18  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.246-3 /src/c4photo.c /src/* /R/BioCro.R /R/c4photo.R

	I added the option of specifying the effect of water stress either
	on stomatal conductance 'gs' or 'vmax'. This resulted in
	modifications of virtually every file in the source
        directory.
	
2009-02-13  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@vpn3-144119.near.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.246-2 /src/AuxBioCro.c

	Basically getting Century to work. Dealing with the timestep issue
	and decay rates.

	* BioCro_0.244-0 *

	Virtually all the source files were changed and everything was
	re-organized. Now, several files have headers. I think this might
	make it easier to communicate between components of the program.

2008-12-09  Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.243-5 /R/BioCro.R /src/AuxBioCro.h

	After playing around with Century I decided to incorporate more
	detail in the calculation of water stress. Now it is possible to
	specify the type of soil (i.e. sand, clay, loam).

2008-12-08  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.243-3 /R/Century.c /R/Century.R

2008-12-05 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.243-1 /src/Century.c
	
	Wrote the C version of Century	
	
	* BioCro_0.243-0 /R/Century.R

	* BioCro_0.242-8 /R/Century.R

	Testing the Century function. Making changes to the CentTest.r

	* BioCro_0.242-6 /R/OpBioGro.R 

	Trying to fix the OpBioGro function. After all the changes I made
	this function does not work any more. Will have to fix this at a
	later time.

2008-12-02  Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.242-5 /src/BioCro.c added the decline in Sp with the
	growing season

2008-12-01  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.242-4 /src/BioCro.c

	Fixe line 913 of BioCro.c and revert back to leaf nitrogen and
	vmax and alpha calculations.

2008-11-30  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.242-2 /src/BioCro.c /R/BioCro.R

	Adding the option to control the extinction coefficient of diffuse
	irradiance.
	

2008-11-29  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.242-1 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	I have found several places where I could improve the code and
	bugs, etc.  I have improved the calculation of the first and last
	day of the growing season. I have included dao and hour in the
	output of BioGro function. It seems that the problem with high
	irradiance at night can be solved by using a higher extinction
	coefficient for diffuse light. So this was changed in the sunML
	function.

2008-11-25 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.241-4 /R/BioCro.R

	Modifying the BioGro and MCMCBioGro function interface where there
	are defaults for the thermal time periods and the dry biomass
	partitioning coefficients. 

	Added the calculation of leaf, stem, root and rhizome litter.

2008-11-24  Fernando Miguez   <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.241-3 /src/BioCro.c /src/AuxBioCro.h

	Added a function that calculates maintenance tissue respiration.

2008-11-22  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.241-2 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	Various changes: added a parameter which controls the effect of
	water stress on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. The
	effect is essentially linear. Also added the output of this
	coefficients.

	I also started a major overhauling of code. Simplyfing a lot of
	stuff and avoiding the repetition of code. I think this kind of
	effort deserves a higher number in the versions. For example, I
	eliminated the c4photoC2 function and the repetition of code in
	the c4photoC function. There is more of this work that I need to
	do.

2008-11-21 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.231-1 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	Will go back and add the option to determine the initial
	proportion of Rhizome that is turned into biomass.

2008-11-20  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.231-0 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	Today I will work on the effect of leaf N on Vcmax for this I need
	Franks data, but only to parameterize the model not to develop it.

2008-11-19  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.230-9 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	Reverted to a small amount of initial leaf area as default. Also
	added the option of including a senescense time for the stems to
	simulate stem decay.

2008-11-19 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.230-8 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	Added the possibility of specifying the initial amount of biomass
	which is turned into leaf in the first hour.

2008-10-14  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.230-7 /R/Opc4photo.R

	Modified calculation of residual sums of squares for Opc4photo and
	Rsqc4photo

2008-09-15 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.230-6 /src/AuxBiocro.h

	Removed the functions I added in the previous version and
	corrected the soil depth bug.

2008-09-10 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.23-5 /R/c3photo.R /R/c3photo2.R /R/Opc3photo.R

	Added these functions. They are at a very ealry stage.

2008-09-09 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.23-4 /src/BioCro.c

	Made changes to the SABioGro function where the absolute value is
	taken for the coefficients to disallow unreasonable values. I
	realized about this problem after testing the function
	extensibly. This also generated a problem where some of the
	coefficients were larger than 1. Also changed the numbering and
	removed the trailing zero. Maybe in this way I will have something
	decent faster.

2008-09-08 Fernando Miguez    <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.230-3 /R/BioCro.R

	Added the functionality of ploting densities in the
	plot.MCMCBioGro function and also man page.

2008-09-04 Fernando Miguez   <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.230-2 /R/SatWatVap.R /test/swv.r

	At this point I'm making several changes to the test script for
	/tests/testMCMCBioGro.r I also modified /tests/OptimBioGro.r and
	it seems that it does not work well in some cases.

2008-08-29 Fernando Miguez   <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.230-1 /src/BioCro.c

	Minor change to McMCc4photo where I commented out rnum and rden.

2008-08-28  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.230-0 /src/AuxBioCro.h

	After running Shark I noticed that most of the computing time is
	spent in using the power function. This definitely surprised
	me... I replaced in the c4photoC function some pow(.,2) by x*x to
	see if it helps. But mostly it was the fnpsvp function which was
	the bottleneck so I replaced the Goff-Gratch equation by the Arden
	Buck which is much more efficient.

2008-08-25  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.229-9 /R/BioCro.R /src/BioCro.c

	Synchronization of the MCMCBioGro function and BioGro. There were
	difference in the way water stress was handled and MCMCBioGro did not
	allow for the specification of a timestep or soil parameters.

2008-08-24  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.229-8 /R/c3photo.R /R/OpBioGro.R

	Starting the c3photo function in its R version. Fixed serious bug in the
	OpBioGro function

2008-08-22  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.229-7 /R/RSS.BioGro.R

	Added this simple function and made some changes to the
	documentation. Also added the simDat2 data.

2008-08-21  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>

	* BioCro_0.229-6 /src/BioCro.c

	Modified the McMCc4photo function where I do not include the calculation
	of the ration in the metropolis ratio. Also I have taken logs to make
	the calculation simpler. I also have made similar changes to the
	SABioGro function.

2008-08-20  Fernando Miguez  <fernando@miguez.igb.uiuc.edu>

	* BioCro_0.229-5 /src/BioCro.c /R/BioCro.R

	for MCMCc4photo.

2008-08-12   Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local> 

        * BioCro_0.229-0 /R/BioCro.R

	Adding a method where the likelihood is approximated using the RSS.

2008-08-03   Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local> 
	
        * BioCro_0.228-9 /R//BioCro.R

        improved the plot.MCMCBioGro function to handle multiple (max 3) objects
	for trace and density of coef 1 and 2.

2008-07-24   Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local> 

	* BioCro_0.228-8 /R/BioCro.R and /src/BioCro.c

        Allow for missing data. I decided to try converting missing data to -1
	since the ISNA macro in C is too slow (or so it seems).

2008-07-23   Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local> 

	* BioCro_0.228-7 /R/BioCro.R

        Added the option of specifying the intercept and slope to the
        Ball-Berry model. This requires minimal changes to the BioGro function
        but more drastic changes to the MisGro function in /src/BioCro.c

2008-07-22   Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local> 

	* BioCro_0.228-6 /R/weach.R /R/man/EngWea94*.Rd

        Added the three dots to lightME in the weach function.
        Added the man pages for EngWea weather datasets.

        * BioCro_0.228-5 /R/BioCro.R

        cleaning up after the SABioGro C code was executed in the
	MCMCBioGro function

	/R/src/BioCro.c LN 2732

	minor changes to documentation and new dataset

2008-07-07   Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  

	* BioCro_0.228-0 /R/Rmiscanmod.R

	This is a new function which implements MISCANMOD.

2008-06-27 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  

        * BioCro_0.227-9 /R/BioCro.R FN BioGro

	Fixed (again) the bug in this function. LN 80

2008-06-25 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  
	
        * BioCro_0.227-8 /R/BioCro.R FN BioGro

	Fixed remaining bug in the determination of the first and last day of
	the growing season.

2008-06-24 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  
	
	* BioCro_0.227-7 /R/BioCro.R FN BioGro


	Fixed bug in the determination of the first and last day of the
	growing season. Also created a new function soilParms (modeled
	after nlmeControl) that should make it easier to control soil
	parameters.

2008-06-24 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  	

	* BioCro_0.227-6 /R/BioCro.R FN BioGro 

	Allowed for missing first day of the growing season and/or last day of 
	the growing season.

	Added the prototype of miscanmod

2008-06-19 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  	

	* BioCro_0.227-5 /src/AuxBioCro.h FN wtrsrt /src/BioCro.c FN MisGro /R/BioCro.R FN
	BioGro

	Added the possibility of specifying soil parameters the the BioGro
	function. For this, I had to change MisGro and wtrstr.

2008-06-18 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  		

	* BioCro_0.227-4 /src/AuxBioCro.h FN c4photoC and EvapoTrans


	I'm reaching the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with the
	EvapoTrans function. However, the results are extremely sensitive
	to the choice of the intercept of the Ball-Berry model. Going from
	0.05 to 0.01 makes a huge difference because it mostly affects the
	evapo/transpiration at night. This represents a lot of loss of
	water when integrated over a whole growing season. It seems that
	the Potential Monteith and Priestly give very different results
	and in fact they don't seem useful. For the example, I can show
	the results of all the other variables which do seem reasonable.

2008-06-18 Fernando Miguez  <fernando@fernando-miguezs-macbook-pro.local>  			

	* BioCro_0.227-3 /src/AuxBioCro.h FN c4photoC LN 254

	I made a mess in the EvapoTrans function. I'm following Campbell to
	try to get reasonable results for the Deltat.

BioCro 0.227-2 --------------- 06-18-2008

/src/AuxBioCro.h FN c4photoC LN 254 
----------------------------------- 

Using the Ball-Berry model instead of gsrh function. The gsrh function was
eliminated. Also synced the c4photo and c4photoC functions.

BioCro 0.227-1 --------------- 06-17-2008

Updated the man page for CanA. I also finally corrected the bug in the
EvapoTrans function and allowed to accept different values of vmax, alpha and
Rd.

Changed the units of layer conductance in the EvapoTrans function to
return more readable values.

Allow for different reltative humidities (need to fix this function).
Studying the complicated EvapoTrans function.

BioCro 0.227-0 --------------- 06-16-2008

Expanding the data returned by CanA. Now there are detailed, by layer,
information about a lot of environmental variables and calculated ones.

BioCro 0.226-9 --------------- 06-13-2008

Today I'm trying to change the timestep for the BioGro function. So
that if the data are entered every 3 hours, say, this would be accounted for.

I also modified the weach function and added an argument for the time step.

I also added the complete data observed by Beale.

I'm noticing that the MCMCc4photo function does not take into account water stress?

I have eliminated the direct reduction of water stress on stomatal conductance.


BioCro 0.226-8 --------------- 06-8-2008

Hopefully fixed the calculation of water stress on the production of new leaf.
Changed the initial amount of Rhizome converted to Leaf, Stem and Root to a
small amount 1e-4.


BioCro 0.226-7 --------------- 06-7-2008

In the previous version 0.226-6 I made a lot of changes, but now I'm reverting
to version 0.226-5 and making one change at a time.

1) Fix errors in lightME function. Changing atmP from 10e5 to 1e5 changed
   results drastically. But this is excellent as now I get more reasonable
   answers than before.

2) Still need to fix the issue of the EvapoTrans function for two reasons. a)
   allow for variable vmax, alpha, etc. b) check the function that calculates
   the difference in temperature between the canopy and the air.

For this last point I need to continue with the effort in 0.226-6 and study the
CanA function.

BioCro 0.226-5 --------------- 06-5-2008

All day testing the MCMCBioGro function and improving the plotting method.

BioCro 0.226-4 --------------- 06-4-2008

Improving the MCMCBioGro function and the plot and print respective functions.

BioCro 0.226-3 --------------- 06-3-2008

Incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to the SABioGro
function. Not sure if it is correct yet.

Added print and plot functions to the new MCMCBioGro function

BioCro 0.226-2 --------------- 06-2-2008

Modifying the SABioGro function to make it a more proper MCMC function.

BioCro 0.226-1 --------------- 05-31-2008

Added a printing function for BioGro. Allowed for 50 layers maximum for the
multilayer canopy model. I have found that for very large LAIs and dry biomass
production there can be an appreciable difference of using more layers.

BioCro 0.226-0 --------------- 05-30-2008

Changes in the documentation (man pages).

MCMCc4photo: usage and examples.

SABioGro: soon this function will be called MCMCBioGro but there is a little bit
more work that I need to do.

BioCro 0.225-10 --------------- 05-29-2008

Changes in the documentation (man pages). 

c4photo: Today I also checked the behavior of the model compared to the data
used in the original Collatz paper (it is amazing that it took me so long to do
this, altough it is perfectly possible that I have done this in the past and
forgot about it).

CanA: fixed the man page. Need to find out the units for canopy
conductance. Also, need to make this function more flexible adding the option to
control more parameters.

OpBioGro: moved functions indtmp and tmpFun to BioCro-internals.

BioCro 0.225-9 --------------- 05-26-2008

Improved the plot.BioGro function to be more flexible and to provide more
sensible plotting. Also fixed the plot.Opc4photo function. Need to create a
similar one for OpEC4photo.

BioCro 0.225-8 --------------- 05-25-2008

I'm changing the OpBioGro function to keep up with the changes I have made
regarding initial water content and dark respiration.

BioCro 0.225-7 --------------- 05-24-2008

I added the dark respiration in the MCMCc4photo function and the BioGro
function. Next time I use functions that depend on these like OpBioGro I have to
modify them to reflect the changes in stomatal conductance stress and dark
respiration. The SABioGro does not take into account the changes in dark
respiration.  I have changed the SABioGro function so that it provides a second
iteration where lower RSS are accepted.

I am making some changes to the SABioGro function (my masterpiece, haha). Now it
allows for different priors to the standard deviations for the parameters. Here
is an idea: I can do this in the future. Let the user set the standard
deviations for the parameters and if this is zero for some parameter then it
won't be optimized.


BioCro 0.225-6 --------------- 05-23-2008

I'm adding the ability to specify the dark respiration in the c4photo
function. This should then be added to the other functions that depend
on the calculation of c4 photosynthesis.

BioCro 0.225-5 --------------- 05-14-2008

Modified the SABioGro function to omit missing values (only for root
for now) in the calculation of the squared distance in RSS_BG function.

Need to add

  o Scale parameter to the SABioGro
  o Missing option for the other components

BioCro 0.225-4 --------------- 05-13-2008

Added the option to specify the initial Water content in function
BioGro. Corrected the mistakes in the previous change 0.225-3 where the
two datasets had identical precipitation; now, they reflect irrigated and
rainfed conditions.

BioCro 0.225-3 --------------- 05-12-2008

Added data sets with weather data from Clive Beale's field
experiments. I added one dataset with irrigation 'EngWea94i' and one
without 'EngWea94rf'.

BioCro 0.225-2 --------------- 05-11-2008

Added the water stress effect to the SABioGro function and modified the EngWea95
file to include precipitation from the original paper from Beale. The data were
provided by Clive Beale and it is in files called 'Fig 1 data.xls' and
'Evapo. data from James.xls'

A few changes need to be incorporated. 

 o Change the SABioGro.Rd file to make it work and also more interesting
 o Update the plot.BioGro.R function to handle colors, line types and 
   point characters


BioCro 0.225-1 --------------- 05-10-2008

Added the water stress function to the AuxBioCro.h file This function is called
in the MisGro function in the BioCro.c file. It attempts to introduce an
empirical reduction in the specific leaf area and thus in the leaf expansion
rate based on a simple water budget.

BioCro 0.224-2 --------------- 04-21-2008

Changed man files for c4photo and eC4photo to reflect the effect of changing
different parameters of their functions. eC4photo is strange in that the maximum
Assimilation I can get is close to 42. I haven't figure out why yet.

BioCro 0.224-1 --------------- 04-07-2008

Change Opc4photo to allow the user to control the optimization method.

Added the SABioGro function. This function seems to work acceptably to get good
initial values for the most important parameters given *only* dry biomass data
partitioned in stem, leaf, root, rhizome, LAI.

I also moved the CanAC function from the BioCro.c file to the AuxBioCro.h file
since it is not really needed here.

BioCro 0.223-3 --------------- 03-31-2008

Change AuxBioCro.h if Cs is less than zero (LN 93) then it is set to 100. Not an
elegant solution but it seems to occur only rarely.

BioCro 0.223-2 --------------- 03-28-2008

Allow for different intercept and slope for the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance
model in function c4photo.

WARNING: The c4photoC2 and others use 3 and 0.08 as values for the Ball-Berry
model.

BioCro 0.223-1 --------------- 03-25-2008

Remove unnecessary code and experimental functions for simulated annealing. Fix
a few documentation bugs.  Added data for precipitation to the cmi0506 data and
also modified the weach.R function to handle precipitation data and the
documentation for the cmi0506 data
